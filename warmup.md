# Instructions
### Your task: Write a program in the editor, that makes Karel move, pick a beeper, then move.



**If you are feeling stuck ask a question on the public discussion [forum](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/public/forum):**


The "editor" is the area to the right with the tab heading "main.py" where you can write text. You should write a solution as a Karel program.



Your program should have a main function with three commands:

1- move()

2- pick_beeper()

3- move()

When you hit the run button, your program will execute line-by-line. After it finishes, Karel's world should look like this:

Confused? No worries. This problem uses material from chapters 1 through 4 in the [Karel Reader](https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/intro.html). Have you read that yet?
