# Stanford-Code-In-Place-2024
Code in Place is a free introductory programming course using the Python language, based on material from the first half of Stanford University's established intro course, CS106A. It assumes no prior programming experience. You won't receive a grade in the course, and completing it doesn't earn university credit. Instead, the main outcome is that you will have acquired a new and wonderful skill: how to program.
